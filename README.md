# TwitchRaid

You want to raid on Twitch and don't really know who you should raid.

Here is a simple program that checks all your followers on Twitch and gets those that are live in a list.

From that list, one is randomly chosen and will get the raid.

All with just one button.


#Setup

Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console and create an Application on http://localhost:3000
Save the Client-Id and Client-Secret
